Handjob in bed is a ⚠️***dangerous***⚠️ sex move involving a bed and any positive<a href=#1><sup>1</sup></a> number of hands.
To start, the one with the hands, who cannot<a href=#2><sup>2</sup></a> be the same person with the member, must place their hand upon the member.
This is when reality darkens and strange noises are heard.
The ground opens, houses collapse, and the skies open to give way to impending doom.
One may liken these events to Mass Effect sex scenes, but in truth they are brought forth by the old god Horngo awakening.
The participants will try to run, they always do, but Horngo will get them in the end.
He is swift, and his hand strikes with a precision not known to man.
After Horngo has taken his offering<a href=#3><sup>3</sup></a>, the celebration may commence, for Horngo has been sated.
